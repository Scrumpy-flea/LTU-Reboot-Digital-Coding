  <!-- HTML intro, 4/5/21-->

    <h3>04/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>Html Introduction</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I have learned the basic code needed to create a html website. The tags used, why they are used and meanings. eg &lt;h1&gt; is used for a title heading. I also found out how important it is for headings to be organised correctly. To help with accessabiity needs.
      The webpage has a &lt;head&gt; This is where data about the page is stored. Usually, this data isn't seen on the page.
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We started by forking the files needed from github. Now, I am able to alter and add to the html files in stages with all that I have learned.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I throughly enjoyed the lesson, I find the advise Alex gives really interesting. Today, I feel I didn't struggle at all.</p>

<!--CSS INTRO 6/5/21 -->
  <article>
    <h3>06/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p> We compared a website made with just html and then saw it with the CSS added. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Css is the styling rules that apply to your page. It's stored and written in a seperate document, which we discovered how to connect that to our html. I have learned the different CSS class, id and tag selectors and how to apply properties and give them values. We also looked into colors, fonts and all the avilable options. Also some simple CSS properties and how to use visual studio code to 
      look for different available values. We used Dev tools to inspect the box model on a bbc webpage. Alex drew boxes to help us visualise the elements and spacing they require, While he explained the box model. Margins, padding and borders can affect the way elements layout on a page. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We have been creating our own google homepage. Today we started creating our own css file for our google. We linked the stylesheet to the html file and added a couple of rules.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found the box model explinations helped me get a clearer understanding. </p>

<!--CSS CONT 11/5/21 -->
  <article>
    <h3>11/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>More CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p> We discussed layout in CSS. We discussed layouts for different size screens. The difference between reactive and responsive. Reactive is no longer used in practise, but it was essentially writing seperate code and files for different size screens. Responsive is using Media Queries to 
      declare different rulesets for different size screens. Meaning webpages are easier to manage. <br />
      Css code should be stored in a seperate file to your HTML. However, inline styles can be applied 'Above the fold'. As 50% of users will leave a page if it hasn't loaded in 2.5 seconds. As the styles are in the html document the browser will be able to load them immediatly. <br />
      Flexbox is a easy way to plan layouts in your css design. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We put flexbox into practise on our google homepages. We needed to set the navigation links to sit in a evenly spaced line accross the top of the page.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found the CSS flexbox a little confusing, espically the properties and values and how they affect the main and cross axis. Eg, justify-content and align-items. <br />
      After playing flexbox froggy, I feel like I have a better understanding when it comes to flexbox layout. I also looked into flexbox on w3 schools. </p>

<!--FINISHING HTML/CSS 13/5/21 -->
  <article>
    <h3>13/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>Finishing up With HTML and CSS. Creating a project.</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I had hands on practise at creating a webpage. The page will showcase some animals, and will have filters, so only the animals clicked will be shown. There will be a text input, so we can filter the animals by their descriptions. 
      eg, jumping into water. <br />
      We discussed what the page needs, and drew out a diagram of the finished website. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We coded the HTML and css for the page. We used free images sourced from <a src="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank">Pexels</a><br />
    We discussed layout, and Alex helped us lay the images into rows on the page. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Adding all the images, was a little tricky, but by carefully checking my code, it all worked well. =</p>

<!-- FUNC + CONTROL FLOW 20/5/21-->
  <article>
    <h3>20/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>Functions and control flow.</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today we learned how functions work in javaScript. A function is a set of resuable bit of code. We can then get this function to return a value by calling it using the return keyword. Arguements (bits of data) can be passed to the function to be used.
      We also learnt that arrow functions are a new way of defining functions. We discussed comparision operators (++, ==, ===, !=, &nbsp;=, etc), logical operators (&&, ||, !) and there role in javaScript.<br />
      We learnt about if-else statements and their use in javaScript. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Alex talked us through the practial work. Writing simple Functions for a shops website. Using the console we got a sense of how the data is passed through the function. And how we can achive different results. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found javeScript itself a little confusing, espically as there are serval ways to do the same thing, but by having a go ourselves, it helped it make a little more sense. Alex was always avilable to anwser any questions we had. </p>

<!--JS PRACTIALS 25/5/21 -->
  <article>
    <h3>25/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>JavaScript Practials 1</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>We learnt about Switch Statements. These are very useful for comparing variables and having certain code run, depending on the outcome of the variable comparison. 
      We compared these to if else statements and how they differ and looked at situations for using each. 
      Alex showed us how to make a simple calculator. Using built in methods like isNAN. (Is Not a Number = This checks if the datatype passed in is a number.)
      The process was carefully explained and we understood how to check our code works while writing such programmes. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Alex guided us through writing a simple drinks ordering programme as a switch statement, so the order put in returns the order. It also validates it to make the function more useful.  </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>The syntax on javaScript has to be very exact for the code to run correctly. I learned its important to check my code is typed correctly.
       Variables also need to be spelled correctly everytime I call them. Even Capital letters have to be taken into consideration.</p>

  <article>
    <h3>27/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>JavaScript, Arrays, Objects and Loops.</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Arrays and Objects a datatypes, that are available on lots of different langagues. An array is a collection of data, with each peice of data has a number attached to it. Loops are a reapeatable piece of code. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We where guided through the practical work, where we made examples of working loops and objects. We discussed their differences and where they may be used. When then moved onto loops and Alex helped us make a working loop that 
      produced the times tables to 12. We first passed the number we wanted to be times by into the loop. We then made a loop of the numbers to be passed in, So we had a loop in a loop. 
    We also learnt about adding a condition to make the loop finish. </p>

    <p>I didn't quiet understand how the internet worked ....</p>

  <h4>JavaScript, Arrays, Objects and Loops Practical.</h4>
  <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
  <p>
    We put the JavaScript we learnt in the previous week into practise. Alex talked us through 
  </p>
  <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
  <p> 
    We used a ready made shopping basket that contained items and created a program that added the price of those items up. 
    When then looked at changing the program to spilt some of the items into catagories. Eg, Toiletries, produce etc.  
    Then Alex talked us through making a progamme that would add discount coupons to the order.
  </p>
  <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
  <p>Getting my code to work correctly was the tricky part. Alex helped me debug my code and gave me helpful tips to use if I get stuck again.</p>
