    <h4>Html Introduction</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I have learned the basic code needed to create a html website. The tags used, why they are used and meanings. eg &lt;h1&gt; is used for a title heading. I also found out how important it is for headings to be organised correctly. To help with accessabiity needs.
      The webpage has a &lt;head&gt; This is where data about the page is stored. Usually, this data isn't seen on the page.
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We started by forking the files needed from github. Now, I am able to alter and add to the html files in stages with all that I have learned.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I throughly enjoyed the lesson, I find the advise Alex gives really interesting. Today, I feel I didn't struggle at all.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p> We compared a website made with just html and then saw it with the CSS added. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Css is the styling rules that apply to your page. It's stored and written in a seperate document, which we discovered how to connect that to our html. I have learned the different CSS class, id and tag selectors and how to apply properties and give them values. We also looked into colors, fonts and all the avilable options. Also some simple CSS properties and how to use visual studio code to 
      look for different available values. We used Dev tools to inspect the box model on a bbc webpage. Alex drew boxes to help us visualise the elements and spacing they require, While he explained the box model. Margins, padding and borders can affect the way elements layout on a page. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We have been creating our own google homepage. Today we started creating our own css file for our google. We linked the stylesheet to the html file and added a couple of rules.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found the box model explinations helped me get a clearer understanding. </p>

    <h4>More CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p> We discussed layout in CSS. We discussed layouts for different size screens. The difference between reactive and responsive. Reactive is no longer used in practise, but it was essentially writing seperate code and files for different size screens. Responsive is using Media Queries to 
      declare different rulesets for different size screens. Meaning webpages are easier to manage. <br />
      Css code should be stored in a seperate file to your HTML. However, inline styles can be applied 'Above the fold'. As 50% of users will leave a page if it hasn't loaded in 2.5 seconds. As the styles are in the html document the browser will be able to load them immediatly. <br />
      Flexbox is a easy way to plan layouts in your css design. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We put flexbox into practise on our google homepages. We needed to set the navigation links to sit in a evenly spaced line accross the top of the page.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I found the CSS flexbox a little confusing, espically the properties and values and how they affect the main and cross axis. Eg, justify-content and align-items. <br />
      After playing flexbox froggy, I feel like I have a better understanding when it comes to flexbox layout. I also looked into flexbox on w3 schools. </p>

    <h4>Finishing up With HTML and CSS. Creating a project.</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I had hands on practise at creating a webpage. The page will showcase some animals, and will have filters, so only the animals clicked will be shown. There will be a text input, so we can filter the animals by their descriptions. 
      eg, jumping into water. <br />
      We discussed what the page needs, and drew out a diagram of the finished website. 
    </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We coded the HTML and css for the page. We used free images sourced from <a src="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank">Pexels</a><br />
    We discussed layout, and Alex helped us lay the images into rows on the page. </p>
